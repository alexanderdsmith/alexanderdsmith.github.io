        <h3>Computer Architecture (CSCI 2400)</h3>
        <p>This course was an introduction to low level software design, hardware-software interfacing, and programming in C. I enjoyed this course a lot, and plan to continue using the knowledge I gained in this course to develop new medical technologies and devices.</p><br>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3>Operating Systems (CSCI 3500)</h3>
        <p>Another excellent course in low-level computer science. Transactions between different software layers was discussed as an extension of what was learned in Computer Architecture</p><br>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3>Artificial Intelligence (CSCI 3760)</h3>
        <p>An introduction to heuristic learning, tensor flow, machine learning, and other aspects of computer intelligence. I took this course because I am very interested in the relationship between computer learning and human learning.</p><br>
