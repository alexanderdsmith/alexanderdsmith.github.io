      <h2>Computer Science Courses at Saint Louis University</h2>
      <div>
        <h3>Computer Architecture (CSCI 2400)</h3>
        <p>This course was an introduction to low level software design, hardware-software interfacing, and programming in C. I enjoyed this course a lot, and plan to continue using the knowledge I gained in this course to develop new medical technologies and devices.</p><br>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3>Operating Systems (CSCI 3500)</h3>
        <p>Another excellent course in low-level computer science. Transactions between different software layers was discussed as an extension of what was learned in Computer Architecture</p><br>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3>Artificial Intelligence (CSCI 3760)</h3>
        <p>An introduction to heuristic learning, tensor flow, machine learning, and other aspects of computer intelligence. I took this course because I am very interested in the relationship between computer learning and human learning.</p><br>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3>Machine Learning (CSCI 4930)</h3>
        <p>A course that expands on topics of artificial intelligence, networks, flow, and critical aspects to reinforced and non-reinforced learning.</p><br>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3>Capstone Project I/II (CSCI 4961/4962)</h3>
        <p>Senior Project based on development of a user interface for concept maps of biological processes. This project is based in MEAN Stack website development following the Agile software engineering process. The critical components of this project include feedback-response agents, user log in utilizing Google's OAuth 2.0 (SAML) authentication interface, and a complete understanding of JavaScript website integration.</p>
